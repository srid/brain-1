Hey! I’m a product manager & builder, music maker/snob, remote work advocate, writer, husband and DIY enthusiast. I live and work in central Massachusetts with my wife and dog.

I love digging into the deeply human psychology behind how and why people solve problems, and helping to create more solutions to help people.
