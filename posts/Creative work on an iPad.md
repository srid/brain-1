# Creative work on an iPad
We all have smartphones. Some people even have a smartphone and/or a tablet in lieu of a computer. 

The rest of us still rely on laptop or desktop computers, sometimes multiple, in our daily lives. My office is lined with ugly black desktop PCs sitting underneath thousands of desks, each with dual monitors attached. My mixing engineer relies on a souped-up PC to run massive Pro Tools sessions. My [designer/photographer fiancée][1] pretty much lives in Adobe’s Creative Suite. 

Since starting my current job, I’ve had some spare time to audit the devices I use in my daily life. While I still rely on my trusty Mac for recording and sequencing music ideas, I’m opening up to the idea of being more portable. I got an **iPad Air 2** a while ago which sat for months on a table, idle except for occasional bits where I decided to read an article on a bigger screen than my iPhone. 

The iPad is a beautiful device, and rather than feel obligated to sell it, I tried using it for actual work - and (for the most part) it was a lovely experience. The smaller screen and ergonomics  of having to touch the screen allow for **less distractions** and **more fun, natural interaction** with daily tasks and communication with my contacts. One might feel initially slower in their workflows when starting on an iPad as a result of this stuff - I know I did - but that in itself caused me to be switching between apps less, and focusing more. 

The problems of the iPad are largely due to the nature of the software itself - for example, there's no file system. You basically need a cloud storage solution (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) to get one. It sounds like Apple may be trying to [remedy this with their own solution][2], but it's a tough thing to get used to and is troubling for those working with many large files. Also, the smaller screen isn't for everyone in a productivity context - some creative workers rely on their larger screens to make careful edits to their work or make sense of lots of content at once.

## Hardware: you don't need a lot of it
The iPad Air 2 is an amazing piece of hardware - and Apple has only improved upon it with the iPad Pro - but for lots of users, this isn't enough. For starters, you only have one input jack - the Lightning adapter - which also is required for charging the thing. That is a clear limitation for those working with lots of hardware peripherals, like musicians and videographers. Don't expect your external RAID storage or Thunderbolt interfaces from working in this context. However, there are some options here - like using a powered USB hub, which I'll come back to in a bit - and many manufacturers are beginning to make iPad-friendly versions of their devices, like iOS-ready hard drives and audio interfaces. 

Also, a touchscreen keyboard isn’t going to cut it for long-form writing or significant productivity. That’s probably why there is a [whole market dedicated to 3rd-party keyboards for iPad][3], plus a whole host of other accessories to beef up your tablet game. I bought myself the solid, minimalist and affordable [Anker keyboard][4], but there’s hundreds of options to match your typing habits and personal style.

There's also a market for plenty of other iPad accessories - cases, stands, chargers are just a few things for which you can find hundreds of options. Generally, go for what fits your style; if the reviews are good, it's probably a reliable product. The point: while you won't have the sheer power and flexibility of several inputs on an iPad, you don't need a lot of hardware to make your iPad useful. 

## For musicians
I’ve had a lovely, if not challenging, time making my iPad work for me musically. The learning curve is quite low, and while the possibilities aren’t endless there’s a bunch you can do, both for fun and for work. 

Those who have recorded music on desktop and laptop computers know the possibilities regarding digital audio hardware. There are hundreds of audio interfaces available, with tons of inputs and outputs, various connectivity protocols (Thunderbolt being the newest), and more. With the iPad inevitably comes restrictions, but they’re surprisingly less than you’d think. With an [Apple Lightning-to-USB adapter][5] (the name doesn’t do this thing justice), you can hook up any USB-powered audio interface to your iPad. My personal favorite is the newest [Apogee Duet][6], which is optimized for both Mac and iPad and has an extra USB out - this allows me to run both audio *and* a MIDI controller into my iPad Air 2. That said, there are still plenty of options to choose from - other popular favorites are the [Focusrite Scarlett 2i2][7] and the new [Novation Audiohub][8], which bizarrely has no XLR ins/outs but has 3 USB outputs (perfect for iPad DJs).

Let’s go back to Lightning-to-USB for a second. Given that you only really have 1 USB input to work with on an iPad, your controller options are limited. This can be mitigated, however, through powered USB hubs or expansion-ready hardware. Personally, I haven’t yet found a powered USB hub that works 100% reliably with an iPad (though many have recommended this one before), but the possibilities brought upon by the Apogee Duet are interesting. I’m currently planning an experiment to daisy-chain controllers through the Duet, by using the new [Korg Micro series][9] of controllers, the keyboard of which has additional USB outputs.

Now, onto software. If you search the App Store for musical instrument apps, or even effects apps, there’s a ton of them out there. Apple’s own Garageband app has plenty of music-making tools within for only $5. However, the most essential app I recommend to musicians experimenting with iOS devices is **Audiobus**. This thing is, by far, the best signal-routing solution for an iPad. You

Once Audiobus is set up on your iPad, you can expand quickly - they even have an app directory built in. Some of my favorite apps to use with Audiobus are:
- **Loopy HD** - if you watch Jimmy Fallon’s show, you probably already know about this app, but it’s hands-down the best live looping solution I’ve ever had the privilege of using. I use this to write constantly, and will be incorporating it into my live performances in the near future.
- **Auria Pro** - this is the closest thing to a proper DAW on iPad.
- Novation Launchpad
- ** iGrand Piano** - for piano-playing on the go. It’s a little pricey at $20, but it’s the best sounding piano I’ve found and is far quicker and easier to start up than opening up Logic or Reason from my Mac. Tap and go.
- **DM1** - this is my favorite drum machine for iPad. It has a surprisingly large set of drum machines to try out, plus a solid few acoustic drum samplers. Plus, it’s only $4.
- Any Reason users out there? If so, check out **Thor**, which is the same amazing polyphonic synthesizer you know and love but in a smaller package.
- The **Holderness Media suite** of effects apps are dead-simple, beautiful and cheap add-ons to your iPad music arsenal. My personal favorites are Echo Pad and Crystalline

Last, but not least, dealing with audio files. If you’ve ever messed around with Garageband before, you know that the sharing options are limited: M4A-quality audio pushed to the iTunes Store, Apple Music Connect *(which, who cares, honestly?)* or SoundCloud. The aforementioned Auria Pro has the lovely capability of exporting WAV mixdowns of your works, but how do you get that out to collaborators or for public consumption? Here’s a few suggestions I have:

- Many iOS music apps have built-in **Dropbox** integration. I’ve found that Dropbox is a fabulous cloud storage solution for working with audio. If you don’t have or want to use Dropbox, however, iCloud or Google Drive should work fine, and the aforementioned Documents app can act as your central repository across all your cloud storage devices.
- Need to quickly convert audio for sharing? There’s surprisingly an app for that - check out **Audio Convert**. It’s dead simple and dirty cheap.

## For writers
Writing on an iPad is one of the most pleasant experiences I’ve had with technology lately. Sure, you can blog from your laptop - but the propensity for distraction is high, and much time can be wasted. I’ve come to realize that the ergonomics of an iPad - eschewing a trackpad immediately in reach in exchange for a touchscreen - allows me to focus more directly on writing; in order to switch contexts, I’d need to move my hands up to the screen.

What’s the best way to write on an iPad? Of course, there’s a ton of options. It sort of depends on your line of work. I mainly blog, write lyrics and occasionally sketch ideas for longer-form writing. For this, I prefer **Ulysses** - it’s pricey ($20), but it’s worth it. It gives you a full-on ecosystem for any writing you do, from note-taking to entire novels. There’s a ton of case studies on its use in a writer’s daily life, and they’re pretty compelling. Hey, I wrote this blog post using Ulysses!

Not ready to take that plunge? There are plenty of other options. **Byword** **iA Writer** and **1Writer** are all beautiful, solid options that don’t quite have the same organizational feature set as Ulysses, but are easy-to-use, powerful and beautiful on an iPad screen.

Alternatively, if you’re used to writing text to perform tasks more than for creative purposes, **Drafts**  and **Editorial** are interesting (read: amazing) apps to explore. These apps let you write with nearly the same scope as the above options, but with additional scripting capabilities built in. Both apps allow you to easily share your texts to other apps in various contexts.

## For artists & photographers: the options are endless
Artists, designers and photographers have a whole host of apps to aid in their design workflow. Unlike the music space, the iPad lends itself well to visual artists on its own thanks to a beautiful touchscreen and new peripherals like the Apple Pencil. 

Let's talk about software then. I'm not a photographer or designer, but I have a need to tinker with visuals on an tablet occasionally. For this, I rely on **Procreate**, the pre-eminent drawing and coloring app for iPad, and **Pixemator**, a beautiful, surprisingly powerful Photoshop replacement. 

Regarding photography apps, I will only say this: there are literally thousands of options here. From simple filters and effects to full-on photo retouching apps, there are plenty to try to your liking. I personally love Afterlight, Filters, VSCOcam, and (of course) Instagram. 

Last, but certainly not least: for people familiar with **Adobe’s** ecosystem, most of their apps have an iOS counterpart. They’re not *quite* as powerful as their desktop counterparts, but if you’re on the go and need to make a quick edit, pull in your Creative Cloud files and Photoshop away. I personally love Adobe Photoshop Elements for iPad, and Lightroom is a solid counterpart to try as well (or at least my fiancée told me so).

## Staying productive
Creative work still begets lots of day-to-day management of said work. Fortunately, the iPad can also be a productivity powerhouse thanks to beautiful and detailed task management, client management, mind mapping, and many more apps. Some of my favorites follow. 

For task management, I can't recommend highly enough **2Do** and **Trello**. The former is a highly customizable Apple Reminders replacement, and the latter is a more visual project management tool that I've been writing about for years. Anyone running a business or managing multiple projects should try these apps out. 2Do has a high price point, but frequently gets discounted; Trello is free with some nice business power ups. 

For brainstorming, I like **MindNode** - it allows you to easily sketch out related ideas in a mind mapping framework and can easily take in text ideas from places like your Reminders. 

Sometimes you have to do math, and sometimes you need to keep track of a lot of math around the same idea. For that, **Soulver** is amazing. It molds basic text and complex arithmetic into a framework that lets you perform calculations and annotate them in line, which is helpful for things like budgeting. 

In virtually all lines of work, there are lots of files and documents to be managed. For this, I love Readdle's **Documents** app. It integrates directly with virtually all cloud services, including FTP servers, lets you auto-sync files to your iOS devices, and even has a built in media player and PDF viewer. I love this thing for keeping track of mixes of my own songs-in-progress. 

Sometimes you need your apps to talk to each other. This, for a while, was nearly impossible in iOS - however, two apps have made your apps (and data and content) more extensible than ever: **Workflow** and **IFTTT**. These two apps have done wonders for me (and millions of other people) to easily pass files, text, data and other content across many apps and manipulate it for pretty much any purpose. I won't get too deep into either app, because the possibilities with both are massive; however, if you find yourself using more than a couple of apps daily, I highly recommend trying both apps out. I use Workflow daily for sharing content across multiple social networks, grabbing audio from the Internet, organizing my thoughts into coherent bundles, and more. 

## Productivity, simple or complex to your liking
Let's be honest: there are way too many apps in he iOS App Store. There are dozens of perfectly capable and powerful apps for all sorts of productivity needs. I’ve found countless times that, despite the souped-up functionality many 3rd-party apps provide to increase your productivity, you most likely waste more time optimizing and tweaking those apps that you end up *losing* time. This is a problem - and I've found the recommendations of a few trusted sources really valuable here. 

Personally, I **love** Apple’s stock Mail, Calendar, Notes & Reminders (as of iOS 9) to manage my day-to-day workflow of tasks, notes and email. Each of these apps have much more functionality than what appears on the surface:

- Trying to get your inbox under control? **Mail** gives you a nice set of Smart Folders to focus on only unread email, only emails from today, and more. You can also bring any mailbox or folder to the top-level with a simple few taps.
- **Calendar** is beautiful and it works. I don’t know about you, but I don’t need a different version of the same thing.
- **Reminders** is my top-level view of everything I need to do or worry about. Need a special view to see to-dos in a particular context? Just make another list for it. Or search your tasks for common keywords. You don’t need that super-special smart folder. 
	- Need to quickly change a due date? Got an iPhone 6s/6s Plus? 3D Touch your reminder. Just do that.
	- Need to remind yourself to check a website? Remind yourself about it via the Share extension in Safari…or pretty much any other app that allows for sharing. I rely on this thing daily to keep track of things I find during the day but want to revisit at night after work.
	- Need to remind yourself about a whole list of things? I’ve become incredibly reliant on **Notes** and **Reminders** in parallel. I’ll type up a note containing a bunch of information and checklists around something I need to do, and then add a Reminder for it via Siri. 


Need something more for your email, tasks or notes? There's a ton of options here, many of which you're probably already using on your Mac. Evernote, Trello, Wunderlist, 2Do, Google's suite of apps, Microsoft Office - each of these are amazing on the iPad, and worthy contenders for managing your creative projects and communication. 

---- 
If technology has given us anything, it’s given us a ton of options for how we do things in our daily lives. That can be overwhelming, so anything one can do to control or constrain themselves is essential to retaining some sense of calm. I’ve found that working on an iPad forces a certain level of restriction, and I’ve been pleasantly surprised with the results so far.
